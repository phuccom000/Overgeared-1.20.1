new block idea

something like high flame from hot iron that act like a primitive furnace that can smelt early game ores but it will produce ash as it burns
its made by putting a campfire on top of a charcoal or coal block and will continue to burn if you keep feeding it fuel but once it burns out it leaves a pile of ash
you can use that ash to make gray dye or mix with clay to make smeltery brick to make the brick alloy smeltery
furnace will now require iron to make as well

you can make permanent high flame by putting campfire on top of netherrack

surround clay with a tool head to make a mold (will break after certain uses)

melt steel inside the nether alloy furnace with a tool head in the mold slot to make steel mold that last permanently (the original tool head will be destroyed)
